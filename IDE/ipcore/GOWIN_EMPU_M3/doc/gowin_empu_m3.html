<h1>Gowin_EMPU_M3</h1>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p><strong>Type:</strong>  Gowin_EMPU_M3 <br />
<strong>Vendor:</strong>  GOWIN Semiconductor</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Gowin_EMPU_M3 includes MCU Core System, AHB Bus System and APB Bus System.</p>
<p>MCU Core System is built on a high performance processor core “Cortex-M3”, with a 3-stage pipeline Harvard architecture, making it ideal for demanding embedded applications. The processor delivers exceptional power efficiency through an efficient instruction set and extensively optimized design, providing high-end processing hardware including a range of single-cycle and SIMD multiplication and multiply-with-accumulate capabilities, saturating arithmetic and dedicated hardware division. The processor implements a version of the Thumb instruction set based on Thumb-2 technology, ensuring high code density and reduced program memory requirements. The MCU instruction set provides the exceptional performance expected of a modern 32-bit architecture, with the high code density of 8-bit and 16-bit microcontrollers. The processor closely integrates a configurable nested interrupt controller, to deliver industry-leading interrupt performance. The processor implements a complete hardware debug solution. This provides high system visibility of the processor and memory through either a traditional JTAG port or a 2-pin serial wire debug port that is ideal for microcontrollers and other small package devices. The processor provides multiple interfaces using AMBA technology to provide high speed, low latency memory accesses. It supports unaligned data accesses and implements atomic bit manipulation that enables faster peripheral controls, system spinlocks and thread-safe Boolean data handling. The processor has an optional memory protection unit that provides fine grain memory control, enabling applications to utilize multiple privilege levels, separating and protecting code, data and stack on a task-by task basis.</p>
<p>AHB Bus System and APB Bus System are the bus interfaces suitable for high-performance synthesizable designs. It defines the interface between components, such as masters, interconnects, and slaves. AHB Bus System includes AHB1 and AHB2, AHB1 bus loads GPIO, Ethernet, DDR3 Memory, SPI-Flash and AHB2 Extension is for user to design AHB peripherals. APB Bus System includes APB1 and APB2, APB bus loads UART0, UART1, Timer0, Timer1, Watch Dog, RTC, I2C Master, SPI Master and APB2 Extension is for user to design APB peripherals.</p>
