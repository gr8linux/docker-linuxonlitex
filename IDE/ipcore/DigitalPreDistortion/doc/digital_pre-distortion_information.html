<h1>Digital Pre-Distortion</h1>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p><strong>Type:</strong>  Digital Pre-Distortion<br />
<strong>Vendor:</strong>  GOWIN Semiconductor  </p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Digital Pre-Distortion (DPD) is one of the most fundamental building blocks in current wireless communication systems. It is used to increase the efficiency of power amplifiers. The efficiency of a power amplifier can be greatly improved by reducing the distortion produced by the power amplifier when it operates in its non-linear region.</p>
