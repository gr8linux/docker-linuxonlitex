<h1>RiscV AE250</h1>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p><strong>Type:</strong>  RiscV AE250<br />
<strong>Vendor:</strong>  Andes</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The Gowin AndesCore™ AE250 IP is a 32-bit CPU IP based on AndeStar™ V5 architecture which incorporated RISC-V technology, it is capable of delivering high per-MHz performance and operating at high frequencies, at the same time it is small in gate count. The Gowin AE250 IP also supports single and double precision floating point instructions and half precision load/store. The Gowin AE250 IP comes with options, including branch prediction for efficient branch execution, Instruction and Data caches, Local Memories for low-latency accesses, ECC for L1 memory soft error protection. AE250’s 5-stage pipeline is optimized for high operating frequency and small gate count. Features also includes PLIC and vectored interrupts for serving various types of system events, AHB 32-bit bus, PowerBrake and WFI mode for low power and power management, and JTAG debug interface for development support.</p>
