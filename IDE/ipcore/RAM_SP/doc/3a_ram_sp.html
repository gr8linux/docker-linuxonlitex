<h1>SP</h1>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p><strong>Type:</strong>  SP<br />
<strong>Vendor:</strong>  GOWIN Semiconductor</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>B-SRAM can be configured as Single port Block SRAM. In this mode, the design supports different read and write data widths. It can be initialized by a memory initialization file. And also, it supports five working modes including two read modes (bypass and pipeline), and three write modes (normal, write-through, and read-before-write). </p>
<p>In SP mode, the primitives SP and SPX9 can be used. The primitives support multiple data widths and address depths(Depth x width): SP--8Kx1, 4Kx2, 2Kx4, 1Kx8, 512x16, 256x32; SPX9--1Kx9, 512x18, 256x36.  </p>
<p>NOTE: The memory initialization file format only supports binary.</p>
