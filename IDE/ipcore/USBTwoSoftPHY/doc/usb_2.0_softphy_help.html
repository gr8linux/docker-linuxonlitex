<h1>USB 2.0 SoftPHY</h1>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p><strong>Type:</strong>  USB 2.0 SoftPHY<br />
<strong>Vendor:</strong>  GOWIN Semiconductor<br />
<strong>Summary:</strong>  The USB 2.0 SoftPHY IP core is a transceiver compliant with the USB 2.0 Transceiver Macrocell Interface. It is capable of transmitting and receiving serial data at high speed (480M bit/s) data rate. While transmitting, the PHY serializes data, generates Synchronize (SYNC) and End-of-Packet (EOP) packet fields, and performs bit stuffing and Non-Return-to-Zero Inverted (NRZI) encoding. While receiving data, the PHY recovers incoming data and clock, de-serializes data, strips SYNC and EOP fields, and performs bit un-stuffing and NRZI decoding.</p>
