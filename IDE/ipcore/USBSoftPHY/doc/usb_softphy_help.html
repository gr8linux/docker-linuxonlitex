<h1>USB 1.1 SoftPHY</h1>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p><strong>Type:</strong>  USB 1.1 SoftPHY<br />
<strong>Vendor:</strong>  GOWIN Semiconductor<br />
<strong>Summary:</strong>  The USB 1.1 SoftPHY IP core is a transceiver compliant with the USB 1.1 Transceiver Macrocell Interface. It is capable of transmitting and receiving serial data at full speed (12M bit/s) data rate and low speed (1.5M bit/s) data rate. The USB 1.1 PHY core performs low-level protocol and signaling functions. While transmitting, the PHY serializes data, generates Synchronize (SYNC) and End-of-Packet (EOP) packet fields, and performs bit stuffing and Non-Return-to-Zero Inverted (NRZI) encoding. While receiving data, the PHY recovers incoming data and clock, de-serializes data, strips SYNC and EOP fields, and performs bit un-stuffing and NRZI decoding.</p>
