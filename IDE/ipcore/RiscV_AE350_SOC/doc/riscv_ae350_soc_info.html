<h1>RiscV AE350 SOC</h1>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p><strong>Type:</strong>   RiscV AE350 SOC <br />
<strong>Vendor:</strong>  GOWIN Semiconductor</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>RiscV AE350 SOC platform integrates A25 Core, a 32bit CPU base on RISC-V. There are UART0, UART1, SPI, I2C, PIT, 32bit GPIO, DMA, WDT, RTC and SMU peripherals integrated in this platform. Extended AHB master and slave interface and APB interface can be used by user to define their own SOC system.  </p>
<p>A25 Core is a 32-bit CPU IP core which incorporated RISC-V technology, it is capable of delivering high per-MHz performance and operating at high frequencies, at the same time it is small in gate count. A25 Core also supports hardware multiplier, hardware divider, single-precision and double-precision floating point instructions, and MMU for Linux based applications. A25 Core comes with options, including branch prediction for efficient branch execution, Instruction and Data caches, Local Memories for low-latency accesses, ECC for L1 memory soft error protection.  </p>
<p>A25 Coreâ€™s 5-stage pipeline is optimized for high operating frequency and high performance. Features also includes PLIC and vectored interrupts for serving various types of system events, AXI 64-bit or AHB 64/32-bit bus, WFI mode for low power, and JTAG debug interface for development support.  </p>
