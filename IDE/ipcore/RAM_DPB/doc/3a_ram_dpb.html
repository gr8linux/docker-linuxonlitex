<h1>DPB</h1>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p><strong>Type:</strong>  DPB<br />
<strong>Vendor:</strong>  GOWIN Semiconductor</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>B-SRAM can be configured as Dual-port Block SRAM(DPB). In this mode, the design support  different data widths. Both port A and port B can read or write. It can be initialized by a memory initialization file. And also, it supports five working modes including two read modes (bypass and pipeline), and three write modes (normal, write-through, and read-before-write). </p>
<p>In DPB mode, the primitives DPB and DPX9B can be used. The primitives support multiple data widths and address depth (Depth x Width): DPB--8Kx1, 4Kx2, 2Kx4, 1Kx8, 512x16; DPX9B--1Kx9, 512x18.</p>
<p>NOTE:   </p>
<ul>
<li>The value of Depth*Width of port A must be the same as that of port B.</li>
<li>The memory initialization file format only supports binary.</li>
</ul>
