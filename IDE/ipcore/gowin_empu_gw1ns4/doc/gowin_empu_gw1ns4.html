<h1>Gowin_EMPU</h1>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p><strong>Type:</strong>  Gowin_EMPU <br />
<strong>Vendor:</strong>  GOWIN Semiconductor</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Gowin_EMPU is a System-on-Chip FPGA device that embeds MCU hard core, Gowin FPGA Fabric as well as other standard peripherals and featured hard cores, including 32K-Byte FLASH and configurable 2K-Byte or 4K-Byte or 8K-Byte or 16K-Byte SRAM. The MCU contains a low power, low cost and high-performance ARM Cortex-M3 32-bit RISC. The flexible FPGA Fabric serves as user programmable peripherals, or soft-core IPs.</p>
<p>All internal block and sub-block functions of the Gowin_EMPU, including the MCU(with supporting AHB/APB Bus System/Extension Ports and Standard Peripherals â€“ GPIO/UART/Timer/RTC/Watch-Dog), FPGA Fabric (with BSRAM, User Flash, Sub-Memory Controller, rich clock and flexible Logic Resources) and JTAG Config-Core are all designed around the ARM Cortex-M3 processor core. The ARM Cortex-M3 processor provides the core for high-performance, low-cost platform that meets the needs of minimal memory implementation, reduced pin count, and low-power consumption, while delivering outstanding computational performance and exceptional system response to interrupts.</p>
