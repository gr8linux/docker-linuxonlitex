<h1>Gowin_PicoRV32</h1>
<h2>Information</h2>
<p><strong>Type:</strong>  Gowin_PicoRV32 <br />
<strong>Vendor:</strong>  GOWIN Semiconductor</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Gowin_PicoRV32 is intended for deeply embedded applications, and integrated into GOWIN FPGA. Gowin_PicoRV32 is based on RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture, it can be configured as RV32I, RV32IC, RV32IM, RV32IMC MCU, and optionally contains a built-in interrupt controller and a 32-bit timer. Gowin_PicoRV32 can either boot from instruction memory or boot from external SPI Flash, and can run in instruction memory or external SPI Flash. The MCU is highly optimized, which only takes 2K~4K LUTs in GOWIN FPGA. The maximum frequency of system clock is up to 50 MHz, and the average cycle per instruction is around 6, depending on the mix of instructions in the code. Dhrystone benchmark result is 0.516 DMIPS/MHz, for the Dhrystone benchmark the average CPI is 4.10.</p>
<p>Gowin_PicoRV32 has two standard bus interfaces, Wishbone bus interface and AHB bus interface. The Wishbone bus is a small-size high-performance logic bus, which can communicate to other slave devices. There contains a UART, an I2C master, a SPI master and a SPI slave on Wishbone bus, and an open Wishbone interface for customized extensions. Also, for the AHB bus, users can connect customized peripherals of AHB bus interface to Gowin_PicoRV32 with AHB bus interface.</p>
